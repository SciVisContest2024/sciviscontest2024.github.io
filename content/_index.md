Welcome to the *2023 IEEE SciVis Contest* website.
This contest is held annually as part of the [IEEE VIS Conference.](http://ieeevis.org)  
In 2023, the conference and this contest will be held in Melbourne, Australia, and will focus on the visualization of  
 ***neuronal network simulations of plasticity changes in the human brain***.

On this website, you can find information on the provided [data,](/data) the visualization [tasks,](/tasks) as well as the [submission process.](/submission)  
If there still are questions, feel free to contact the [contest chairs](mailto:scivis_contest@ieeevis.org) or join the [Google Group.](https://groups.google.com/g/scivis2023).
